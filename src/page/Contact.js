      <p>If you have any questions, feel free to reach out to us!In English, an article is a word that is used before a noun or noun equivalent to indicate if the noun is specific or not. Articles are a type of adjective because they describe the noun that they precede. The three articles in English are "a", "an", and "the". "The" is the definite article, while "a" and "an" are the indefinite articles. For example, "the house", "a cat", and "an activity" all use articles</p>
